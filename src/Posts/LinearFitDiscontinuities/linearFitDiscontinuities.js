          How could you estimate a noisy linear function if it contained regular discontinuities?
          The most natural place where this can come up is when the range of the function
          &quot;wraps around&quot;. Angles and rotations are natural examples of this, as they vary
          between 0&deg; and 360&deg;. For myself, I came upon this problem when trying to estimate
          the linear rate of change for an angle.

          <Typography variant="body1">
            The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), is an optimized algorithm for computing a Discrete
            Fourier Transform (DFT). The standard Fourier Transform operates on a continuous
            function. The DFT serves the same purpose, but for discrete functions. A sampled
            continuous function would need a DFT as it is no longer continuous. Due to this, almost
            all numeric Fourier Transforms are in fact DFTs.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            The FFT is an interesting topic in itself. In my opinion, it is one of the most
            important algorithms of the 20th century (technically 19th century, but it was not
            popularized until later). While not accurate, for the purposes of this post the FFT
            computes the Fourier Transform.

            <a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/">LAPACK</a> (again, an interesting topic in

            there are similarities between the two types. In fact, vectors have an &quot;is a&quot;

          To visualize the amplitude, plot the absolute value of the FFT output. Notice the large
          spike and how its location remains invariant in the presence of noise. Yet, as the noise
          increases past a certain threshold, the spike becomes indistinguishable form the noise. At
          this point, the clock-speed becomes irrecoverable.

          In the above post I have shown how to linearly fit a signal that has regular
          discontinuities. This method does not use computationally intensive non-linear
          curve-fitting. Instead, this approach is robust to noise and gives a practical use for the
          Fourier Transform. I hope to further explore some of these topics, such as the Fourier
          Transform, linear algebra, and optimization, in future posts.
